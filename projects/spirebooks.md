### What is SpireBooks?

SpireBooks was the result of a course project for the course ICS 414: Software Engineering II, in which teams were tasked with developing a web application to be used as a financial projection and management decision tool for the local CPA firm Spire Hawaii. My team and I which consisted of 8 team members (called Team Half and Half), were tasked with building this application for Spire employees to effectively use while also meeting with the customer every two weeks for insightful feedback. During the process, we were given example sets of data to represent the equations and financial metrics used by Spire and needed to develop the app to take data inputs and present these projections in an easily understandable and aesthetic way. Different employee roles were also taken into account along with data tied to each role implemented within the application. Different forms correlated to projectional graphs that could be adjusted to account for shifting metrics and audits performed by Spire. 

This process of development followed Issue Drive Project Management (IDPM), more commonly referred to as Agile Project Management, which included a consistent group work schedule, prioritizing communication, dividing and assigning tasks to individual group member (with each task being separate within its own branch), documenting the development process, and separate milestones to account for the different stages of development and progress we had made towards the final product. Each week, we were also tasked with focusing on 2 files within our project to perform code reviews, which allowed us to improve our coding standards and create a more professional development environment.

### Main Contributions

While I did hold many different duties within Team Half & Half throughout the course of the project, tha main contributions I made throughout the various milestones are as follows:

- **UI Design and Functionality**
- **User Roles and Account Data**
- **Application Acceptance Tests**
- **Component Management**
- **Code Refactoring**

More in-depth looks at my work and contributions can be viewed through the Projects tab found within the spirebooks repository linked [here](https://github.com/orgs/Team-Half-and-Half/projects).

Insights into the actual functionalities and aesthetics of the app can be found on the Team Half and Half .io page which can be accessed by clicking [here](https://team-half-and-half.github.io/).
