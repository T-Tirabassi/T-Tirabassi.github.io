summary: "My team and I created UH Repcompanion, an application designed to connect University of Hawai'i students seeking gym partners."
---

UH RepCompanion was the result of the final project for the course ICS 314: Software Engineering I, in which teams were tasked with developing a web application based on a set of given prompts. My group and I were tasked with developing a web application that would allow for university of Hawai'i students to connect with one another to find compatible gym companions who they could then workout with at the on campus gym, hence the name UH RepCompanion.
