summary: "My team and I created UH Repcompanion, an application designed to connect University of Hawai'i students seeking gym partners."
---

UH RepCompanion was the result of the final project for the course ICS 314: Software Engineering I, in which teams were tasked with developing a web application based on a set of given prompts. My group and I were tasked with developing a web application that would allow for university of Hawai'i students to connect with one another to find compatible gym companions who they could then workout with at the on campus gym, hence the name UH RepCompanion. This process of development followed Issue Drive Project Management (IDPM), more commonly referred to as Agile Project Management, which included a conistent group work schedule, prioritizing communication, dividing and assigning tasks to indidividual group member (with each task being separate within its own branch), documenting the development process, and three separate milestones to account for the different stages of development and progress we had made towards the final product. 

The application itself allows University of Hawai'i student to register using their UH email and create a profile for themselves consisting of their name, major, a short biography, a profile picture, workout interests, a tag to designate their level of experience, and optionally social media. Through the application, users can view upcoming workout events created by other users and then connect with that user for that event. Users can also search through other users profiles to connect with others who may share similar workout interests or share the same experience level. Essentially, UH RepCompanion works as a type of social media application for UH students interested in fitness, where they can connect with others and plan out workouts with a gym buddy.

For each milestone of the project, each member within my group was assigned a few tasks that would contribute to the end goal for that milestone. For the first milestone, designated as M1, my tasks included the creation of the Landing Page of the site and serve as the nexus for the application, as well as the creation of the Profile and Edit Profile Pages, where the logged in user would be able to view their profile and allow the user to edit the information associated with it. For the Landing Page, my focus was on not only creating a user friendly and aesthetic ui for the user to navigate, especially in terms first time users of the application, but also the functionality of this page. Given that it served as the foundation for the navigation and access for the rest of the site, it had to be easily discernable and portray professionalism. This page also provided a short description of what UH RepCompanion is and served as the access point for loggin in or registering an account. I mainly focused on the functionality and layout of the page, and later incorporated more unique stylization further into development. As for the Profile Page, I focused more on properly conveying a readble layout for the information that was being drawn from the Profiles collection database. The page itself consisted of a card displaying the information mentioned previously upon registration. Later on in a fututre milestone, I would incorporate more features and stylization to the page itself. The Edit Profile Page basically was a form that the user would fill out and then it would be saved into the MongoDB for the Profiles collection, so the creation of this page was not too difficult. This page would be later updated in accordance to changes within the Profile Page. Much of the work done for this milestone was very basic, as it served as a way for us to build up the foundations for the app to then later expand upon these ideas and incorporate new features for user functionality.

In the second milestone, designated as M2, I was tasked with
