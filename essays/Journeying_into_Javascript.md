Journeying into Javascript


Presenting a Perspective

  Javascript is unique in that it feels familiar yet different in comparison to other programming languages. I believe that many can agree that
Javascript feels a lot simpler in regards to complexity and formatting. The other languages that I am familiar with are Java, C, and C++, all
of which have similar code structure and functionality with what is found in Javascript. Before this, I didn’t have any experience with 
Javascript, but my pre-existing knowledge upon learning Javascript definitely helped to accelerate that process compared to if I had no 
programming experience whatsoever.

I learned of the differences between Javascript and other languages, mainly with aspects such as keyword, 
functions, and directly implementing the output to the console. I also found ES6 a bit more interesting as it sets a relative standard to 
introductory Javascript programming.

A Software Engineer’s Perspective

  From the perspective of a software engineer, I feel that Javascript can be considered both a good and bad programming language depending on 
the approach you take with it. One of the pros of Javascript in a software engineering environment is the easy accessibility that it gives 
to programmers trying to create simple and reliable programs. To me, the different aspects of Javascript are definitely easier to understand 
compared to other languages such as C and C++. Its versatility also allows for it to be used in various different projects, ranging from 
simple to complex. As for its cons, I believe that it is not the best in performance compared to other languages. Javascript’s naming 
conventions are also different from other programming languages, which can sometimes be confusing. One of the biggest drawbacks of Javascript
is that it doesn’t align as much with what you would expect to find in other programming languages.

An Athletic Approach to Software Engineering

  Similar to Javascript, athletic software engineering has both its pros and its cons. Starting with the pros, athletic software engineering is
a good way to get a student such as myself into a rhythmic learning schedule. Similarly to its namesake, the more consistent you are with it,
the quicker you will begin to see results. This consistency allows for an accelerated learning rate which can help develop skills in shorter 
periods of time, such as that of a semester. Athletic software engineering also seems to attract my own attention more, allowing me to 
dedicate more time to actually learning the topics, compared to the mindset of procrastination. Some of the cons of athletic software 
programming mainly stem from one's persistence, perseverance, and willingness to learn. This approach can often induce stress, which may 
lead to less focus and more panicking when faced with an assessment of the material. It also acts as a reminder for me to not fall behind, 
as it will be harder to catch up if I do. This induces a great amount of stress over time management, as it can prevent pouring full focus 
into this environment if there are other outside priorities that hold just as, if not more importance than this routine.

WODs and Woes

  The WODs that we have done so far have helped me to gain a better sense of these assessments, such as the structure or time that we will have
to do them. However, it has also brought about more stress in me for the actual WODs, given that my first attempts did not go very well, and 
I was only really able to fully visualize the problem after watching the videos before beginning my sequential attempts. My time did improve,
but mainly due to the fact that I could now reference the contents of the video in my head, whereas before I was somewhat confused as to 
where to start. I don’t particularly enjoy this style of learning, as I tend to find it very stressful, but I can understand the benefits 
that can come from it. I wouldn’t necessarily refer to this style as enjoyable, but more so intellectually challenging. I can’t say for 
certain whether or not this style of learning will work for me, but perhaps as the semester progresses, I will begin to adapt to this style 
of learning and find it beneficial in developing these skills.
