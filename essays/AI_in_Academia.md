## The Aid of AI

Artificial Intelligence or AI is not only becoming more advanced within the modern day, but also much more prevalent, particularly within academia. Within educational discussions, there is currently the debate of how AI is impacting the education system, and whether or not its use is seen as positive or negative. On one hand, AI can be seen as a tool that can be used as a type of easily accessible support tool for students, while on the other hand it can be argued that students may rely too heavily on the use of AI, passing AI generated work off as their own and not learning the subject properly. Both of these cases hold equal weight, with evidence to support the claims made from these two sides. Software engineering is a field that I personally feel has benefitted from the use of AI, supported by my personal use of ChatGPT as somewhat of a tool or assistant within my programming. The key part here is that while I have used ChatGPT as a tool, I have not completely depended on it, and use it purely as a supportive academic tool within my current software engineering course ICS 314: Software Engineering I.

## Lending to Learning

In regards to the use of AI, I do feel that it has significantly altered the learning experiences I have when approaching various concepts and topics. I believe that AI can assist individuals with the comprehension of different academic materials and experiences, as it can allow for those learning to gain a better understanding or grasp on a topic that they may be struggling with, and have it explained in a way that they can understand. I feel that many students struggle with academic materials not due to their personal fault or that of the one teaching, but the way in which the material is communicated and presented. This stems from the fact that everyone has their own way of learning and the way in which something is taught may be easier for one person to understand, but harder for another. The use of AI also allows an individual to ask more questions that once again, can be explained in a way that they understand and add to an overall better understanding of said topic.

In terms of skill development, this is where AI becomes a bit more debated within academic circles. From a personal standpoint, I try to develop my skills properly as I know that if we were to rely on AI now the lack of these skills would drastically hinder my abilities and career for the future. The way in which I use AI to develop my skills is if I am unsure of how to incorporate something within my code or something specific I wish to incorporate, I may provide ChatGPT with the code I currently have and then ask it a question while being specific. For example, say I have an idea for a feature that I would like to incorporate into my code, but am unsure of how to do so. I may provide the code and ask ChatGPT how I could do this with the given code, and then it may provide me with an answer, but more often than not this answer is incomplete or slightly incorrect. I will then use the base insight it has given me and use the skills I have to incorporate that feature not only properly, but in a way that makes sense to me. This process is present earlier where I mentioned I had used ChatGPT to help me incorporate a visibility feature and tracker within the final project for ICS 314: Software Engineering I.

I feel that in regards to problem-solving abilities, ChatGPT serves as a hindrance. The purpose of developing problem-solving abilities is to not only help you within your career, but also with all other aspects of life and the challenges you may encounter. By leaving the process that goes into solving a problem to an AI, you rob yourself of skills that not only apply to your career, but also to your life as a whole. By following this, one will eventually confront the consequences to this avoidance. Due to this, I personally have focused on developing these abilities personally through years of practice. However, as I mentioned earlier, I may occasionally ask ChatGPT a question if I am genuinely stuck and am unable to find online resources to assist me. For example, say I am running into an error where my code isn’t working properly. I then may provide the code to ChatGPT and ask what the cause of the issue may be, to which it will then provide me with a specific result or possible causes. By seeing how the AI dissects the code to find the problem. I can then use that method to influence how I go about problem solving moving forward, now having gained this new knowledge.

## Characterizing Challenges

While AI has been useful to myself personally throughout ICS 314, I do believe that there are challenges that come with using AI as well as limitations that these simulations of human intelligence impose. For starters, AI uses information from testing and across the web to simulate human response and explanations, yet it is just that, a simulation. AI can not recreate the distinct difference between the assistance or teachings of another human being because it is unable to truly replicate that which makes us human. I think that AI itself is limited due to this, in that it can only spew out the information that has been fed or built upon pre-existing knowledge to attempt to create something new, even though it is essentially a recycled response. Due to this, it may not always prove helpful to use AI when confronting certain problems within software engineering, which is why one should not solely rely upon AI and again use it as a support tool. 

In order to even have the AI assist you, you not only have to understand the concepts you are learning about and working with, but also how the AI receives the information and how you have to interpret it with your own pre-existing knowledge. This presents the challenge of getting the AI to actually prove useful rather than hindering your own performance. Essentially, there are many things that AI can’t do, but you can, and if you are struggling with something, you must combine what you know with the database of knowledge the AI has to produce useful results. However, I believe that the education of software engineering can further integrate AI by educating people on the uses of AI as a tool, what it can and can’t be helpful with, and using it in a way that better educates people on software engineering through the accessibility of more knowledge outside of the classroom.
