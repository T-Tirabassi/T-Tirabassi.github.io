## Initial Impressions

At the beginning of the semester for ICS 414, I wasn't really sure what to expect. I had some idea of how the course would be structured and knew that it would build off of what I had learned from ICS 314, but other than that I had no clue. On the first day of class, we were divided up into our groups for the semester and focused on creating a team name, a team contract, and deciding the beginning steps of development. After discussing a bit about our strengths in terms of software engineering, we found that not only were our skills split between front-end and back-end development but our devices were also split evenly between Windows and Mac. From there, we created a basic team contract for rules member should follow, keeping up with development, being professional, etc. 

We also were informed that the web application we would be devloping would be a financial projection and management decision tool for Spire Hawaii LLP, a local Certified Public Accountant (CPA) firm. After brainstroming a bit, we determined the name for our application, which would be "Spire Books". We also discussed how the site should look and concluded that we should base it off of the actual Spire Hawaii site in terms of design so it matches their professional aesthetic. From here, we began devlopment for the project.

## Deciding Development

In light of our team name of Team Half & Half, our tasks regarding the project were more less split between front-end development and back-end development. For the first milestone our goal was to create several mockup pages that would make up the basis for our project. Since I was more confident with front-end development, my tasks for the milestone was to design the navbar and footer for the web application, allowing users to easily naviaget the site and visit the different pages for the site. While working on this milestone, I also created the logo for our web app, taking inspiration from the original Spire logo.
