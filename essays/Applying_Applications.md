A Spark in Software

To me, software engineering is a very unique field, given that it has so many different applications; pun fully intended. Whether it be the development of mobile apps, computer software, game engines, you name it. From a personal perspective, software engineering is more or less one of the more creative avenues that a computer science student can take. The skills acquired through the learning process of software engineering can be applied in an artistic manner to an otherwise technical field. As someone who wishes to pursue game design and development, software engineering sparks a curiosity for developing these technical skills that can then be applied into this creative medium.

Skill Build

As mentioned previously, my main pursuit in terms of computer science is to get involved in and to develop games. Within the game industry, software engineering plays a vital role in that the software created by those engineers serves as the foundation of the entire game. A game cannot even exist without this software, as the software is what allows the game to run and have all the different assets of the gamer affect and interact with one another. Some of the skills I hope to develop in accordance with this include basic software programming and development, object-oriented design and interactivity, and fundamental debugging skills. As an aside as well, I would also like to dabble a bit in web development and mobile application development, so I would also strive for skills such as basic understanding of web development and the specificity of designing a mobile app compared to say a computer application.

Experience and Expertise

Experience is something that cannot be recognized until one has already shown great effort. Expertise is the accumulation of said experience, and cannot be recognized until lengths of time have been passed with continuous effort. To start my journey into software engineering, I hope to work on different projects such as creating basic websites, basic mobile applications, and hopefully some basic game development. All experience begins at a starting point, where the basics of different concepts are practiced and eventually expanded upon. Through the continuous practice of these projects, they will continue to grow in size and complexity, with the incorporation of new technologies and elements. Not only will projects like the ones mentioned help build my skills, but it will also build upon my resume, and lead me to bigger and better opportunities for the foreseeable future. Hopefully in time I will realize my dreams as a game developer and see the appreciation for my work, and maybe by then Iâ€™ll be able to truly call myself an expert.
